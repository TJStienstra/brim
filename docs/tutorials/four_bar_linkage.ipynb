    "## Overview of the Workflow\n",
    "When forming the EoMs of a system in SymPy, one typically first describes the model after which an algorithmic implementation of Kane's method or Lagrange's method is used to derive the EoMs. In this tutorial, we will use Kane's method. BRiM breaks the model description into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define objects**: Create the objects, such as symbols reference frames, without defining any relationships between them.\n",
    "2. **Define kinematics**: Establish relationships between the objects' orientations/positions, velocities, and accelerations.\n",
    "3. **Define loads**: Specifies the forces and torques acting upon the system.\n",
    "4. **Define constraints**: Computes the holonomic and nonholonomic constraints to which the system is subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows a schematic visualization of these steps for a rolling disc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../_static/definition_steps.svg\" alt=\"Modeling workflow SVG\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After describing the model and forming the EoMs, this tutorial will show how to do a simple simulation using `solve_ivp` from SciPy and visualize the results using SymMePlot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description Four-bar Linkage\n",
    "A four-bar linkage is a frequently modeled system. It consists of four rigid bodies modeled as thin rods with uniform density, where the first body is fixed to the ground. Each of these bodies is attached to the previous via a pin joint. The last pin joint is modeled as holonomic constraints when using generalized coordinates, also called a minimal coordinate representation. In the image below the four-bar linkage is shown. Additionally, we will also model the gravity force acting on the system, introduce a spring-damper element between the first and second body, and have a time-dependent force acting horizontally at the third pin joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../_static/four_bar_linkage.svg\" alt=\"Four-bar linkage SVG\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define Objects\n",
    "The first set of objects to define are the symbols, which represent various quantities in the system. In SymPy mechanics we distinguish two kinds of symbols: [symbols](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/core.html#sympy.core.symbol.Symbol) and [dynamic symbols](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/vector/api/functions.html#sympy.physics.vector.dynamicsymbols). Symbols denote constants, like mass, dynamic symbols denote time-varying functions, like generalized coordinates. The code snippet below defines the symbols and dynamic symbols for the four-bar linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Add the missing symbols and dynamic symbols for the four-bar linkage: `l1, l2, l3, l4, k, c` and `q3, u1, u2, u3`."

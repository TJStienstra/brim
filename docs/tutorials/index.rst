BRiM has several available tutorials. Each tutorial is a Jupyter notebook, which can be
downloaded as exercise locally and run on your own computer. The web version of the
tutorials each show the full solution, so you can also just read through them.

The tutorials are ordered with increasing depth and complexity.
